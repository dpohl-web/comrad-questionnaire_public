This repository contains the frontend application for **Comrad**, a cutting-edge WordPress plugin for creating interactive questionnaires and surveys. Built with **Create React App**, this single-page application (SPA) provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for participants to complete questionnaires created with the Comrad Editor.

## ‚ú® Architectural Highlights & Core Features

This frontend is not just a simple form renderer; it's a sophisticated application built with a modern and scalable architecture to handle complex logic and provide a superior user experience.

-   **Advanced State Management with Redux:**
    The application uses a centralized **Redux store** to manage the entire application state, including questionnaire data, user answers, and UI state. This ensures a predictable state container and makes debugging and testing significantly easier.

-   **Asynchronous Operations with Redux Saga:**
    Instead of simple thunks, we leverage **Redux Saga**, a powerful middleware that handles all side effects (like fetching XML data or submitting results) in a clean and efficient manner. Sagas make complex asynchronous flows easy to manage, test, and reason about, preventing "callback hell" and keeping our components pure.

-   **Component-Based Architecture with React:**
    Built with modern React (v18), the UI is composed of reusable, declarative components. This promotes a clean separation of concerns and makes the codebase highly maintainable and scalable.

-   **Rich UI with Material-UI (MUI):**
    The user interface is built using **Material-UI**, a comprehensive library of UI components that follows Material Design principles. This provides a polished, professional, and accessible user experience out-of-the-box.

-   **Dynamic Questionnaire Rendering:**
    The application dynamically parses and renders questionnaires from XML data, supporting various question types such as sliders, checkboxes, radio buttons, and text inputs.

-   **Interactive User Experience:**
    Features like multi-page navigation (forward/backward), real-time validation, and interactive charts for results (using **Chart.js**) create an engaging experience for the user.
